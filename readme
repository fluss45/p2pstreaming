P2P IPTV System Architecture
¢ Source server
connects to media source using rtsp/mms, converts to P2P
protocol
¢ Relay server
connects to the source server, distribute the packet to P2P
clients
¢ Tracker
manages all the P2P components including source server,
relay, and P2P clients
¢ EPG server
mangers channels information and channels relay amount,
using web technology


P2P IPTV Solution Briefs
Peer-to-peer (P2P) computing or networking is a distributed application architecture that partitions tasks
or workloads between peers. Peers are equally privileged, equipotent participants in the application. They
are said to form a peer-to-peer network of nodes.

Peers make a portion of their resources, such as processing power, disk storage or network bandwidth,
directly available to other network participants, without the need for central coordination by servers or
stable hosts. Peers are both suppliers and consumers of resources, in contrast to the traditional client-server
model in which the consumption and supply of resources is divided. Emerging collaborative P2P systems
are going beyond the era of peers doing similar things while sharing resources, and are looking for diverse
peers that can bring in unique resources and capabilities to a virtual community thereby empowering it to
engage in greater tasks beyond those that can be accomplished by individual peers, yet that are beneficial to
all the peers.
Peer-to-Peer Protocol is an application layer peer-to-peer networking protocol that can be used to form and
maintain an overlay network among participant nodes. It provides mechanisms for nodes to join, leave,
publish, or search for a resource-object in the overlay. It maintains information about nodes in a routing table.
Because of potentially large content, a node's routing table only contains a subset of these nodes.
